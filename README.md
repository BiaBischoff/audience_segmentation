**Case Description**

To what extent does our platform’s acquisition channel influence the learning outcomes of our students?

Are there any geographical locations where most of our students discover the platform, specifically through social media platforms like YouTube or Facebook?

You will work on real-world customer data to perform market segmentation—crucial for businesses to understand customer behavior and improve marketing efficiency. The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, implementation of clustering algorithms, and interpretation of results. You’ll use two popular clustering techniques: k-means and hierarchical clustering.

In the Customer Segmentation in Marketing with Python project, you’ll delve into the diversity of customer behavior and identify distinct segments that could be targeted with personalized marketing strategies.
